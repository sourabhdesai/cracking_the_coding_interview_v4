Ill be periodically posting some of my own solutions to questions from Cracking the Coding Interview Verion 4

Ill be using either C++ or Java ... Ill be trying to use C++ most of the time when I can but otherwise will use Java if I require some of its features.

I do not intend on going in any order or even completing every single problem. Just want to have a log of all the problems I have done and let others see my solutions.

Solutions will be split into chapters and furthermore into problems.
